# ShinyApplicationHeatCA
Heat California Application for display of most effective heat waves in CA

The shapefile is too large to be uploaded, therefore it will need to be downloaded separately from the following link

https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html

Under Zip Code Tabulation Areas as a zip

Once done you can place the files within the shapefile folder and run the app as you can do so directly from the R console locally. 

The app is also deployed in shinyapps.io under https://kristenhansen.shinyapps.io/HeatCA/
